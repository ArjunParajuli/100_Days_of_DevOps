### Task:
Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.<br>
Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.<br>

As the container is stopped and the port mapping wasnt there in that container, we first remove it and recreate a new container with necessary configs:<br>
- remove
docker rm nautilus <br>

- Run fresh with correct mappings
docker run -d --name nautilus \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs \
  httpd:latest
