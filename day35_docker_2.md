##Run a NGINX Container on Docker
The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 1. Complete the task with the following instructions:

On Application Server 1 create a container named nginx_1 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.

#Steps:
 - Pull nginx image: 
  i.e. docker pull nginx:alpine
 - Run the image(creates container), port mapping on port 80: 
   docker run -d --name nginx_3 -p 80:80 nginx:alpine 
 - Check status of container:
   docker ps -a (-a flag for showing all containers i.e running or stopped)
